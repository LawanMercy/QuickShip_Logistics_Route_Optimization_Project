## Project Title : QuickShip Logistics Route Optimization Project

## Background
QuickShip Logistics is experiencing operational issues, including rising delivery costs and increased customer complaints regarding delayed shipments. The laborious and inefficient route design method fails to consider important elements including real-time traffic, vehicle load capacity, and balanced route assignments, contributing to these challenges. This has resulted in poor delivery performance, increased fuel usage, and strained customer relations. 
The current dispatch and routing workflow involves manual order scheduling, basic route creation without advanced optimization, and limited real-time delivery tracking. Inefficiencies have an impact on customer happiness, operational expenses, and employee productivity.

## Problem Statement
QuickShip Logistics is facing challenges due to inefficient delivery operations, resulting in high delivery costs and frequent late shipments. 

- Frequent late shipments
- High delivery cost
- Inefficient delivery operation
- Increased fuel consumption

Having a solution for these problems will boost sales, improve customers satisfaction, reduce costs and most importantly enhance operational flow.

## Project Objectives
- **Primary Objective:** Improve delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction by optimizing the dispatch and routing process.
- **Supporting Objectives (SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):**
  - **Reduce Delivery Costs:** Decrease average delivery costs by 15% within the next 6 months   through optimized routing and fuel consumption management.
  - **Improve On-Time Delivery Rate:** Increase the on-time delivery rate from the current 75% to 95% within the next 6 months.
  - **Reduce Customer Complaints:** Decrease in the number of customer complaints related to late deliveries by 40% within the next 3 months.
  - **Automate Route Planning:** Implement a route optimization system that automates the route planning process for 90% of deliveries within the next 4 months.
  - **Improve Dispatcher Efficiency:** Reduce the average time spent by dispatchers on route planning per delivery by 50% within the next 3 months.
  - **Enhance Real-Time Visibility:** Provide real-time tracking of all vehicles and deliveries to dispatchers and customers within the next 4 months.
  - **Ensure Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure that all routes and driver schedules comply with relevant regulations (e.g., driver work-hour limits) within the next 2 months.

## Requirement Gathering

- **Stakeholders Engagement**

I engaged with dispatchers, truck drivers, warehouse managers, vendors, and customers.

**Why:** To learn about their pain areas and expectations.

**Result:** I compiled a list of user needs such as frequent routes, real-time dashboards, customers complaints and automated order systems.

- **Process Mapping**

To better understand the root cause of the QuickShip Logistics problem, I drafted out a visual workflow of the existing manual route planning process being used.

**Why:** To identify and focus on the areas of delay, customers dissatisfaction, high cost consumption and overall inefficiency.

**Result:** I unraveled issues such as late updates, manual route planning, delayed delivery, etc.
