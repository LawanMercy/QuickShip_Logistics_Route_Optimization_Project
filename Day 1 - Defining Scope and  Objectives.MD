## Project Title : QuickShip Logistics Route Optimization Project

## Background
QuickShip Logistics is experiencing operational issues, including rising delivery costs and increased customer complaints regarding delayed shipments. The laborious and inefficient route design method fails to consider important elements including real-time traffic, vehicle load capacity, and balanced route assignments, contributing to these challenges. This has resulted in poor delivery performance, increased fuel usage, and strained customer relations. 
The current dispatch and routing workflow involves manual order scheduling, basic route creation without advanced optimization, and limited real-time delivery tracking. Inefficiencies have an impact on customer happiness, operational expenses, and employee productivity.
